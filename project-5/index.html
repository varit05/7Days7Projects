        <p>
          JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is an interpreted programming
          language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is
          high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has
          curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based
          object-orientation, and first-class functions.

        <p>
          TypeScript is an open-source programming language developed and
          maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of
          JavaScript, and adds optional static typing to the language.
          TypeScript is designed for development of large applications and
          transcompiles to JavaScript.

          Vue.js is an open-source Model‚Äìview‚Äìviewmodel JavaScript framework for
          building user interfaces and single-page applications. It was created
          by Evan You, and is maintained by him and the rest of the active core
          team members coming from various companies such as Netlify and
          Netguru.
